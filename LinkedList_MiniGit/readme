Mini Git Version Control System
A simple version control system implemented using Java and doubly linked lists. This project allows users to manage commits, branches, and perform operations like reverting commits, deleting commits, and switching between branches. It is a great demonstration of applying linked lists for version control management.

Example Workflow
Create a new branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
Create a New Branch
Enter new branch name: feature
Switch to the new branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
Switch to a Branch
Enter branch name to switch to: feature
Commit changes to the new branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
Commit a Change
Enter commit message: Added a new feature
Enter file content: public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello, World!"); }
View commit history:

How It Works
CommitNode: Represents each commit in the project. Each commit has a unique ID, a message, a timestamp, and the file content.

Branch: Represents a branch in the repository. Each branch contains a linked list of commits.

VersionControlSystem: Handles operations like committing changes, switching branches, deleting commits, etc.

MiniGit: The entry point for interacting with the system. The user can choose from various options in the menu to perform version control actions.
